**Disclaimer**: This is still in a very early stage of development.

But yes, it is finally coming to life.
You can create/edit subtitles on the browser using local files.

Right now we only support `*.mp4` videos and `*.vtt` subtitles.

(early) Roadmap:
- Add support to create new subtitle cues either manually or when typing on an empty input;
- Add support to delete subtitle cues;
- Display snippets of subtitle cues in Timeline
- Add support to extend time of subtitle cue either in Timeline or CueList
- Add support to move the subtitle cues and save the position on the file;
- Add unit tests with jest;
- Add e2e testing with Cypress;
- Deploy preview PRs into GitHub Pages;
- Adjust theming;
- Save settings on localStorage;
- Add header/footer;
- Add support for `*.srt` subtitles (import/export);
- Add support for other video formats;
- Remove console.logs from build;
- Deal with theming;
- Create projects page so the user can have multiple subtitle projects;
