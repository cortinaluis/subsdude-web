1
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,780
Hey, so this isn't matching up with this, and I'm not sure which one's right

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,700
Can you just hunt down the original part. Yes me do all right?

3
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,860
Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork? Me do now.

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,320
Go stop worry

5
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:34,829
Kevin do you feel okay? Me feel good body strong sleep big last night. Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital.

6
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,539
Yeah, all right Kevin, why don't you come with us. No no. He's fine, he's fine. He's always been like that.

7
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,040
No he hasn't. I mean he's gotten worse over the years. He's making a statement

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:51,719
it's an ironic comment on our expectations of him, a funhouse image of our model of Kevin. you keep think that

9
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:57,959
Me mechanic not speak English, but he know what me mean when me say car no go

10
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:04,439
And we best friend so me think why waste time say lot word when few word do trick?

11
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:07,060
Kevin, I appreciate what you're trying to do.

12
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,089
Thank.

13
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:16,409
Here we have a word code the same way we have a dress code and what we're talking about is

14
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,599
Basically the speech equivalent to just wearing underpants

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,759
Sometimes words, you no need use

16
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,689
but need need for talk talk

17
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,995
But save time. more success.

18
00:01:32,995 --> 00:01:34,560
Does it save time though? Cause we've been here for about an hour.

19
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,799
No me fault

20
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:42,750
Kevin at most you're saving a microscopic amount of time

21
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,107
Many small time make big time.

22
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:48,960
What are you gonna do with all this time?

23
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,630
See world.

24
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,309
Kevin you can't possibly save enough time to see the world.

25
00:01:54,309 --> 00:01:56,670
Kevin, are you saying 'see the world' or 'Seaworld'?

26
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:58,750
Seaworld

27
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,340
Oceans. Fish.  Jump. China.

28
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,360
No see right there - that's the problem with your method because I still don't know if you're saying Seaworld or see the world

29
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,440
And it's taking a lot of time to explain it

30
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:17,960
Fine fine, I'll talk normally.

31
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,960
When me president, they see.

32
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,160
They see
